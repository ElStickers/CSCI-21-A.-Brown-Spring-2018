Project 1: Luhn Algorithm

Part A: BIN Card Type identification

- open(file to read)
- check card type by examining first six digits, starting with first digit
    - American Express = 34 or 35
        - check to make sure second digit is 4 or 5
    - Discover = 6011 or 622126 - 622925 or 644 - 649 or 65
        - 6011 : check first 4 digits to find a match
        - 622126 - 622925 : check first 3 digits to find 622, then verify next 3 digits fall between 126 and 925
        - 644 - 649 : check 2nd digit to find 4, then verify 3rd digit falls between 4 and 9
        - 65 : check if second digit is 5
    - MasterCard = 51 - 55
        - check if second digit falls between 1 and 5
    - Visa = 4
    - anything else regarded as unknown
    
Part B: Everything Else

Pseudocode:

Card (Base Class)

    - card number
    - bank type
    - card holder first name
    - card holder last name
    - card type
    - balance
    - array of transactions
    
    + constructor
    + validity check
    + determine bank type
    + accessors
    + mutators

Gold (Derived Class)
    
    - credit line
    - overdraft allowance
    - rebate percent
    
    + constructor
    + determine denied transactions

Platinum (Derived Class)

    - credit line
    - overdraft allowance
    - rebate percent
    
    + constructor
    + determine denied transactions

Corporate (Derived Class)

    - credit line
    - overdraft allowance
    - rebate percent
    
    + constructor
    + determine denied transactions

Transaction

    - card number
    - day
    - month
    - year
    - transaction number
    - vendor
    - amount
    - denial
    
    + accessors
    + mutators

Collection

    - array of Card objects
    - number of Card objects
    
    + output monthly statement
    + fill transactions
    + fill vector
    + output info of specific card

Process:

Collection class contains vector of Card class
open(first input file)
if(not at end of file)
    get current line
    assign values in current line to corresponding Card member variable
Card class contains vector of Transaction class
open(second input file)
if(not at end of file)
    get current line
    assign values in current line to corresponding Transaction member value
copy remainder of transaction member values that were not in input file from the Card they belong to
use all data contained in transaction vectors to format organized monthly bill
    output(transactions that were denied and reason why)
    output(list of transactions for given month with vendor, date, individual amount, and total)
    output(total rebate value, current card balance, and overdrawn status)


transaction is denied if
    - overdraft amount exceeds overdraft allowance
    - card number is invalid






Project Description:

Your application will read in two sets of input data (2 input files). 
The first set of data includes credit card numbers, the name of the account 
holder, the card type (gold, platinum, corporate) and the current balance on 
each card in the format:

CreditNumber FirstName LastName Type - CurrentBalance.  

This data will be used to populate an array of credit card objects.

The second set of data include a series of transactions.  Each transactionâ€™s 
data include the credit card number, the date, a transaction number, the vendor,
and a purchase amount in the format: 

CardNumber:00/00/0000:transactNumber:Vendor:amount

Depending on the validity of the credit card number, the current card credit 
balance and the credit limit, your application will decide if the transaction is 
to be allowed or denied.  Your application will also compute the total purchase 
made on the card, and the rebate amount.

The output of your application will be a list of transactions that are denied 
together with the reason for denial and for each valid credit card account, 
create a monthly bill that would include the summary of purchases, the total 
bill on the credit card, if there is an overdrawn status on the card, and the 
rebate value.

There are 3 types of credit cards:

Gold Card

Credit line $3,000
Once limit is reached, the card will be blocked
Each month, a rebate of 1% of the total monthly purchase is awarded to the account.

Platinum Card

Credit line is $5,000
An overdraft of $1,000 is allowed. A warning message is issued through the account summary
Each month, a rebate of 2% of the total monthly purchase is awarded to the account.

Corporate Card

Credit line of $10,000
An overdraft of $5,000 is allowed. A warning message is issued through the account summary
Each month, a rebate of 5% of the total monthly purchase is awarded to the account.
